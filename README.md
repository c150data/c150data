# c150data
Website for Columbia Lightweight Rowing

Authors: Lukas Geiger and Max Amsterdam

This website is meant to store and meaningfully display workout data for all athletes of C150. 
In order to access this site you must be preregistered by an admin. 

The goal of this webpage is to motivate the athletes of C150 to upload all of their training data. Therefore
we display a list of athletes ranked by the percentage of training hours completed to hours assigned. By 
making this data accessible we hope to motivate the athletes to complete all assigned work. Extra is extra. 

In the future we plan on collecting and analyzing all rowing data and displaying it in a way to give our coach 
oversight of the progress of the entire team.
